# Ok what the hell are we building?

An app that allows content creators to connect with their fans while allowing the market to determine the worth of content.

Content Creators create an ERC721 pass collection on any all-in-one collection generation site (such as Metafuse). They can set limit of passes that can be minted, initial minting price plus many more options that suit their business model. They then connect their collection in our app and can upload and share their content with a few clicks.

Only holders of the content creators collection will be able to see the content posted from the creator. Furthermore, the content creator can push content on a granular level to a specific pass, or a set of traits from their collection.
